        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In this assignment, you will explore higher-order functions in JavaScript. Higher-order functions are
            functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as values. You will implement
            various higher-order functions to solve specific tasks, including reduce, filter, map, and forEach
            functions.</p>
        <h2>Detailed Explanation</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Setup Guidelines and Instructions: Initial Setup: Begin by creating a JavaScript file to write your code. You
            can use any text editor or IDE of your choice for editing.</p>
        <p>Running Your Code: You can run your JavaScript code in any modern browser's developer console or using
            Node.js.</p>

        <h2>Problem statement (complete the following functions).</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>ForEach functions</h3>

        <p>Input</p>
        <p style="border: 1px solid black;background-color: rgb(231, 231, 231); padding: 30px;">
            const sentences = [ <br>
            "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",<br>
            "She sells seashells by the seashore.",<br>
            "I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up.",<br>
            "To be or not to be, that is the question.",<br>
            "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.",<br>
            ];
            <br>
            countWords(sentences)

        </p>
        <p>Output</p>
        <p style="border: 1px solid black;background-color: rgb(231, 231, 231); padding: 30px;">
            output should look like this. <br>
            sentence 0 contains 36 words<br>
            sentence 1 contains 31 words<br>
            sentence 2 contains 42 words<br>
            sentence 3 contains 32 words<br>
            sentence 4 contains 47 words<br>

        </p>
        <p>Given an array of strings representing sentences, write a function that logs (console.log()) the number of
            words in each sentence to the console using .forEach()</p>
        <p>for each sentence print a message "sentence 1 contains 9 words." in console.</p>
        <p>here in the message 1 is index(one base(starts from one)) of the sentence and 9 is the number of words it
            contains.both the value should be changed as per the sentence.</p>
