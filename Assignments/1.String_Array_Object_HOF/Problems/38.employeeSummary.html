        //Example Invocation: <br><br>
        const employees = [<br>
        { name: "John Doe", age: 30, department: "HR", salary: 50000 },<br>
        { name: "Jane Smith", age: 28, department: "Finance", salary: 60000 },<br>
        { name: "Alex Johnson", age: 35, department: "IT", salary: 70000 },<br>
        { name: "Maria Lopez", age: 29, department: "Finance", salary: 65000 },<br>
        ];<br>

        console.log(employeeSummary(employees)); <br>
        // Output: [<br>
        // "Employee John Doe works in HR department and earns $50000 annually.",<br>
        // "Employee Jane Smith works in Finance department and earns $60000 annually.",<br>
        // "Employee Alex Johnson works in IT department and earns $70000 annually.",<br>
        // "Employee Maria Lopez works in Finance department and earns $65000 annually."<br>
