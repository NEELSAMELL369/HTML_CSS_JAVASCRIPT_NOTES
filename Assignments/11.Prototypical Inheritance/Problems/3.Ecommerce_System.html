        <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
        <div>
            You're tasked with developing a sophisticated e-commerce system to manage various products efficiently. <br><br> To
            achieve scalability and maintainability, you opt to implement the system in JavaScript using constructor
            functions and prototypical inheritance.<br> <br>The system should accommodate diverse product types such as
            Electronics, Clothing, and Books, each with unique attributes and behaviors.<br> <br>All products share common
            features like name, price, and quantity, which should be implemented in a base constructor function called
            Product.<br> <br>Specialized products like Electronics, Clothing, and Books have additional properties and methods
            specific to their category. <br><br>For instance, Electronics may have properties like brand and model, along with
            methods like powerOn and powerOff. <br><br>Your task is to design and implement the system, ensuring clear
            inheritance among different product types using prototypical inheritance.<br><br> The system should minimize code
            duplication and effectively handle product management operations.
