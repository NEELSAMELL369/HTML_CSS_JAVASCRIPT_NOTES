        <div>You are tasked with developing a small library management system in JavaScript. The system should manage a
            collection of books and support various operations such as adding new books, filtering books based on
            certain criteria, and performing statistical calculations on the collection. Specifically, you need to
            create a Book class using the ES6 class syntax with properties for title, author, year, and genre, and a
            method to return the book's information as a string. Additionally, you should create a Library class to
            manage the book collection, where the constructor initializes an empty array of books and includes a method
            to add books to the collection. Implement a factory function to create new books. Furthermore, the Library
            class should have methods to filter books published after a given year using filter, return an array of all
            book titles using map, calculate the total number of books using reduce, and calculate the average
            publication year of all books using reduce. Use these components to effectively manage the library's book
            collection and perform the specified operations.</div>
