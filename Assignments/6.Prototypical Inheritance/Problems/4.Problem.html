        <h2>Problem Scenario</h2>
        <p>You are developing a system to manage an online education platform, where each user can be either a Student
            or an Instructor. Implement the system using JavaScript classes and ES6 syntax. The base class User should
            have properties name and email, and a method getDetails that logs "Name: [name], Email: [email]". The
            Student class should inherit from User and add a property studentId and a method enroll that logs "Student
            [name] has enrolled.". The Instructor class should inherit from User and add a property instructorId and a
            method assignGrade that logs "Instructor [name] assigned a grade." Demonstrate the system by creating
            instances of Student and Instructor, and calling their methods.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Note to Candidates:</b> You are expected to use ES6 class syntax for implementing the system. Ensure your
            solution adheres to modern JavaScript standards.</p>
