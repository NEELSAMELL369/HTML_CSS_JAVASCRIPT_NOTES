        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In this problem, you will design and implement a simple library system that manages books and library
            members. The system will distinguish between regular members and premium members, allowing premium members
            to borrow more books and access special collections. This problem will test your understanding of JavaScript
            constructor functions, prototypes, inheritance, and the use of call, apply, and bind.</p>
        <h2>Detailed Explanation</h2>
        <h3>Topics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript Constructor Functions</li>
            <li>Prototypes and Inheritance</li>
            <li>Method Overriding</li>
            <li>Function Context (call, apply, bind)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Setup Guidelines and Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Use any JavaScript environment or IDE to implement the solution.</li>
            <li>Create separate JavaScript files or use modules to organize your code for better readability.</li>
            <li>Write comments to explain the logic and flow of your code.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>You are tasked with designing a simple library system for a small community library. The system should track
            books and the members who borrow them. The library should have two types of members: regular members and
            premium members. Premium members have additional privileges, such as borrowing more books and accessing
            special collections.</p>
        <p>To implement this system, follow these steps:</p>
        <h3>Book Constructor:</h3>
        <p><b>Book Constructor: </b>Create a constructor function for Book that takes the following parameters: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>title: the title of the book</li>
            <li>author: the author of the book</li>
            <li>isAvailable: a boolean indicating if the book is available for borrowing (default is true)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Member Constructor: </b>Create a constructor function for Member that takes the following parameters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>name: the name of the member</li>
            <li>borrowedBooks: an array to store the titles of books borrowed by the member (default is an empty array)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Borrow Book Method: </b>Add a method to the Member prototype to allow members to borrow a book. This
            method should:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Take a Book object as an argument.</li>
            <li>Check if the book is available.</li>
            <li>If the book is available, mark it as not available and add the book's title to the member's
                borrowedBooks array.</li>
            <li>If the book is not available, log a message saying the book is already borrowed.</li>
            <li>Ensure that a member can borrow no more than 3 books at a time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Premium Member Constructor:</b> Create a constructor function for PremiumMember that inherits from Member
            and
            takes the same parameters. Additionally, PremiumMember should have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A specialCollectionAccess property set to true.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Override Borrow Book Method:</b> Override the borrowBook method in PremiumMember to allow borrowing of
            special
            collection books. Use call or apply to reuse the Member borrowBook method as appropriate. Also, premium
            members can borrow up to 5 books at a time.</p>
        <p><b>Demonstrate the Functionality:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create several book objects.</li>
            <li>Create a regular member and a premium member.</li>
            <li>Show borrowing books and the difference in behavior between regular and premium members.</li>
            <li>Use bind to create a bound function for borrowing books for a member.</li>
        </ul>
