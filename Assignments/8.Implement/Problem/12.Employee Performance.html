    <h1>L1 - Employee Performance Evaluation System</h1>

    <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
    <p>
        You are tasked with building an <strong>Employee Performance Evaluation System</strong>.
        You have an array of employee objects, where each employee has the following properties:
        <span class="highlight">name</span>, <span class="highlight">tasksCompleted</span>, and <span
            class="highlight">rating</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Filter the employees who have completed more than 5 tasks.</li>
        <li>Map the filtered employees to a new array that contains only the employee's name and their performance
            level:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If rating is above 4.5 → <strong>“Excellent”</strong></li>
            <li>If rating is between 3 and 4.5 (inclusive) → <strong>“Good”</strong></li>
            <li>Otherwise → <strong>“Needs Improvement”</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Sort the final array in descending order based on performance level: <strong>Excellent → Good → Needs
                Improvement</strong></li>
        <li>Return the final sorted array containing employee names and their performance levels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example:</h2>
    <pre><code>Input:
[
  { name: "Alice", tasksCompleted: 8, rating: 4.7 },
  { name: "Bob", tasksCompleted: 4, rating: 4.0 },
  { name: "Charlie", tasksCompleted: 6, rating: 3.5 },
  { name: "David", tasksCompleted: 10, rating: 4.9 },
  { name: "Eve", tasksCompleted: 7, rating: 2.8 }
]

Output:
[
  { name: "David", performance: "Excellent" },
  { name: "Alice", performance: "Excellent" },
  { name: "Charlie", performance: "Good" }
]
</code></pre>
