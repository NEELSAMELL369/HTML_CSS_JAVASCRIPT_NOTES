            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>You are tasked with developing a car simulation system in JavaScript. The system should manage a car
                object with various properties and methods to simulate its behavior. Specifically, you need to create a
                Car class using the ES6 class syntax with properties for the car's name, accelerationPower (a numerical
                value representing the car's ability to increase its speed over time, measured in meters per second
                squared), brakingPower (a numerical value representing the car's ability to decrease its speed
                effectively, measured in meters per second squared), and speed (the current speed of the car, which
                starts at 0, measured in meters per second). <br>  <br>

                The class should include methods to accelerate and brake the car. The accelerate method should increase
                the car's speed based on its accelerationPower and log "Accelerating" along with the current speed to
                the console. The brake method should decrease the car's speed based on its brakingPower, ensuring the
                speed does not go below zero, and log "Brakes applied" along with the current speed to the console.
                Additionally, implement methods to check the car's current speed, refuel the car (assuming a maximum
                fuel capacity and a method to consume fuel while driving), and simulate a driving session over a period
                of time where the car accelerates and brakes at certain intervals.  <br>  <br>

                Your task is to implement the Car class with the following methods:  <br>  <br>

                accelerate: Increase the speed by accelerationPower and log "Accelerating" along with the current speed.
                brake: Decrease the speed by brakingPower, ensuring the speed does not drop below zero, and log "Brakes
                applied" along with the current speed. checkSpeed: Return the current speed of the car. refuel: Increase
                the fuel level to its maximum capacity and log "Refueled to maximum capacity". drive: Simulate a driving
                session where the car accelerates and brakes at specified intervals, logging the car's speed and fuel
                level at each step. Ensure that the car's speed cannot be negative and the fuel level is managed
                appropriately. Create instances of the Car class and test these methods to ensure proper functionality.
